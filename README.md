## What's up?

Welcome user. I operate a small handful of personal/private repositories mainly 
centered around fun little code projects, my aging homelab/home server setup, 
and maybe, one day, some pipelines and public cloud builds to get a website going.

I do not contribute to public projects with this name - most of the employers I've 
had the pleasure of working with actually forbid unapproved open-source 
contribution as they want first right of refusal for anything I come up with... 
Not that it's particularly gamechanging, just that's how they roll. 

## My stances

- Security is important, except in the context of my lazy code running in my lab.
- Hating on languages for their syntax is irrational.  Hate on poor performance.
- Hating on tabs/spaces is irrational, but cursor navigation has to be comfy.
- I don't do UX/UI.  If I do, it's a console window.
